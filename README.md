## About

Sorcar is a **procedural modeling node-based system** which utilises Blender and its Python API to create a visual programming environment for artists and developers. Heavily inspired by Side-FX Houdini, it presents a node editor with a variety of **modular nodes** to make the modelling workflow easier and fast. Most of the nodes are blender internal operations (bpy.ops.mesh/object) which also makes it easier for frequent blender users to manipulate geometry. It helps the users to quickly create 3D models and **control node parameters** to generate limitless variations in a **non-destructive** manner. It also provides the users to view and edit mesh on any stage of the node network independently, with **realtime updates**.

## Release & Instructions

[Latest Release (v3.2.1)](https://github.com/aachman98/Sorcar/releases/latest)
</br>*Requirement: Blender 2.81 or later*

1. Download the zip file and install it as a Blender addon (Edit -> Preferences... -> Add-ons -> Install...)
2. Open Sorcar Node Editor (**Do not** remove the 3D viewport as it is required by some operations like extrude, transform, ...)
3. Click on the + button to create a new tree
4. Press Shift+A to open the nodes menu. Alternatively, navigate through tabs on the Right panel in the node editor
5. Select the desired node and press "Set Preview"

*Open blender using a command prompt to view logs and errors, if encountered.*
